## üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Email Phishing Detection & Analysis System

PhishGuard is a cybersecurity tool designed to analyze email messages (.eml files) and detect phishing attempts using advanced natural language processing techniques and threat intelligence integration.

**Current Status:** Under Active Development

---

## üìã Overview

PhishGuard represents an innovative approach to phishing detection, designed by and for cybersecurity analysts. Unlike traditional solutions that rely on simple keyword matching, PhishGuard performs comprehensive analysis of emails by examining hidden metadata, link structures, encoding anomalies, and linguistic subtleties typical of targeted attacks.

Our solution uses a hybrid approach that combines expert knowledge with machine learning to create a system that continuously adapts to new attack techniques.

## üîç Key Features

- **Native .eml File Analysis**: Preserves forensic integrity of digital evidence
- **VirusTotal API Integration**: For verification of suspicious domains and URLs
- **Multi-layer Detection Engine**:
  - Header analysis for spoofing detection
  - Content analysis for social engineering tactics
  - URL/domain reputation checking
  - Attachment scanning
- **NLP-based Analysis**: Detects linguistic patterns common in phishing attempts
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive breakdown of suspicious elements
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves detection accuracy over time

## üìä Performance Metrics

Our prototype has been tested on a dataset of known phishing and legitimate emails with the following preliminary results:

- Detection Rate: ~85% (target: 95%+)
- False Positive Rate: ~12% (target: <5%)
- Analysis Time: ~3 seconds per email

These metrics will continue to improve as we refine our models and algorithms.
